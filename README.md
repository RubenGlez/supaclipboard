## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useSupaclipboard } from "supaclipboard";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef < HTMLInputElement > null;

  const { copy, history, paste } = useSupaclipboard({
    historyLimit: 8,
    onCopyError: () => {
      console.log("Error copying");
    },
    onCopySuccess: () => {
      console.log("Copy successful");
    },
    onPasteError: () => {
      console.log("Error pasting");
    },
    onPasteSuccess: () => {
      console.log("Paste successful");
    },
    persist: true,
  });

  const handlePaste = async () => {
    if (!inputRef.current) return;
    const valueFromClipboard = await paste();
    inputRef.current.value = valueFromClipboard ?? "";
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: "40px" }}>
      <div>
        <h1>ðŸ“‹ supaclipboard</h1>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>
          History{" "}
          <small style={{ fontSize: "12px" }}>
            (first item is the last copied value)
          </small>
        </h2>
        <ol>
          {history.map((item, i) => (
            <li key={`${item}_${i}`}>{item}</li>
          ))}
        </ol>

## Roadmap

### Short-term Enhancements

1. **Multi-Format Clipboard Support**: Extend functionality to support not just text, but images, HTML, and custom data types, offering a more versatile clipboard interaction experience.

2. **History Management Features**: Introduce capabilities to edit, remove, or even tag specific items within the clipboard history. This would allow users to manage their clipboard history more effectively.

3. **Clipboard Event Listeners**: Implement hooks that listen to clipboard events (copy, cut, and paste) globally within the app, allowing for automated reactions to these events.

### Mid-term Enhancements

4. **Synchronization Across Tabs**: Develop features for synchronizing clipboard history across multiple browser tabs or windows, using local storage, IndexedDB, or broadcast channels.

5. **Security Enhancements**: Offer security features like sanitization for copied content to prevent XSS attacks when pasting content from or into the web application.

6. **Custom Clipboard Implementation**: For applications that need a custom clipboard experience, provide the tools needed to implement a user-defined clipboard that can interact with the system clipboard.

### Long-term Enhancements

7. **Plugin System**: Establish a plugin system allowing developers to extend the library with custom functionalities, such as integrating with third-party APIs (e.g., saving clipboard items to cloud services).

8. **Advanced Clipboard Formatting**: Add support for preserving formatting when copying text (e.g., rich text formatting, markdown) or converting formats on the fly.

9. **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhance clipboard operations with accessibility in mind, ensuring that all functionalities are fully accessible through keyboard shortcuts and screen readers.

10. **Cross-Platform Clipboard Management**: Explore the possibility of extending `useSupaclipboard`'s capabilities to manage clipboard content across different devices, using cloud synchronization.
